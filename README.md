# C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

## Introduction

 Stack/Queue is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in first-out (LIFO), and the first-in first-out (FIFO) principle.
 The objective of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files using stacks and queues.

## General
 In this particular project, we were able to find out:
    * The different between stack and queue
    * When to use stack and when to use queue
    * The current applications of stacks and queues
    * The most mutual use cases for stacks and queues
    * The appropriate way to use global variables

## Mandatory tasks
0.  push, pall
 Implement the push and pall opcodes:
    * push: push elements to stack
    * pall: print all the elements of the stack
1. pint
 Implement the pint opcode:
    * pint: prints the value at the top of the stack
2. pop
 Implement the pop opcode:
    * pop: take off the top element of the stack
3. swap
 Implement the swap opcode:
    * swap: The top two elements of the stack swap
4. add
 Implement the add opcode:
    * add: joins the top two elements of the stack
